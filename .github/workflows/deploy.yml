**What this file does:**
*   It watches for any `push` to your `main` branch.
*   It then checks out your code, installs all the necessary packages (`npm install`), and runs your build script (`npm run build`).
*   Finally, it takes the resulting `out` folder and deploys it to GitHub Pages for you.

Once you have created this file with this exact content and saved it in the `.github/workflows/` directory, let me know, and we'll proceed to the final configuration step in your repository settings.
